# Data Science Project: Best Linear Predictor (BLP) with Front-End Interface

This project demonstrates how to build a **Best Linear Predictor (BLP)** model for predictive data science analysis and integrate it with a user-friendly front-end interface for real-time interaction.

The project includes:
1. **Data Science Component**: A predictive model built using the Best Linear Predictor (BLP) approach.
2. **Front-End Interface**: An interactive web interface where users can input data and view the prediction result from the model.
3. **Back-End API**: A Flask-based API that hosts the model and interacts with the front-end.

## Project Overview

This project aims to apply the **Best Linear Predictor (BLP)** method to predict a dependent variable from input features. The model is implemented in Python and Flask, while the front-end uses HTML and JavaScript for user interaction.

### Key Components:
1. **Best Linear Predictor (BLP) Model**: 
    - The model is implemented to predict the best possible linear estimate of a dependent variable using input features. It uses a statistical approach to minimize error and maximize prediction accuracy.
2. **Front-End Interface**: 
    - The user inputs relevant data through an HTML form. 
    - The data is then sent to the Flask back-end, which applies the BLP model and returns the prediction.
3. **Back-End API (Flask)**: 
    - The Flask API receives the input data, processes it using the BLP model, and sends back the prediction result.
    - The API also handles requests from the front-end in a JSON format.

## Technologies Used

- **Data Science**: Python, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn (or other libraries for statistical analysis)
- **Back-End**: Python, Flask (for creating the RESTful API)
- **Front-End**: HTML, JavaScript (with Fetch API for making requests to the back-end)
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages (for front-end), Render/Heroku (for back-end)
